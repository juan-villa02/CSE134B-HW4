# Changes applied to my website

Altough I have not had enough time to implement a hamburger menu, I have been able to finally make my website responsive design.

In my previous submission, I was deducted some points for only adapting my website to laptops.

Now, the website perfectly displays on mobile phones and tablets, having a centered menu and scaled objects vertically displayed.


# Third-party addition

As a third-party addition, I decided to embed two LinkedIn posts from my personal acount. I think these posts are a good
way to describe myself and some of my projects at the same time it gives my web a different design apart from simple paragraphs or images.

Additionally, after including these elements into my HTML I decided to alter the order of the homepage, displaying the social posts first. This also implied setting the CSS for these new elements, as well as adding new media queries so that the web still has a responsive design.
