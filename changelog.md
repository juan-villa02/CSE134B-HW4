# Changes applied to my website

Altough I have not had enough time to implement a hamburger menu, I have been able to finally make my website responsive design.

In my previous submission, the website was adapted only for laptop, being able to adpat some objects when reducing the window size.

Now, the website perfectly displays on mobile phones and tablets, having a centered menu and scaled objects.


# Third-party addition
