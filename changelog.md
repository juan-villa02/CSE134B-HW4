# Changes applied to my website

Altough I have not had enough time to implement a hamburger menu, I have been able to finally make my website responsive design.

In my previous submission, the website was adapted only for laptop, being able to adpat some objects when reducing the window size.

Now, the website perfectly displays on mobile phones and tablets, having a centered menu and scaled objects.


# Third-party addition

As a third-party addition, I decided to embed two LinkedIn posts from my personal acount.

Additionally, after including these elements into my HTML I decided to alter the order of the homepage, displaying the social posts first. This also
implied setting the CSS for these new elements, as well as adding new media queries so that the web still has a responsive design.
