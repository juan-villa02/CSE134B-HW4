                <p> This project was focused on the classification of handwritten digits from 1 to 9. 
                    We used the well-known MNIST Dataset (60,000 training images and 10,000 for testing)

                <h3> Project 2: Unsupervised Learning techniques </h3>
                <p> The purpose of this project was to serve as a wide review of the main unsupervised learning techniques used
                    in Data Science projects. The dataset is based on customers from a company, and the main idea is to perform 
                    customer segmentation to implement better marketing campaigns.
